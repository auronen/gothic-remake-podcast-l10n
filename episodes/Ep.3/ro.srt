1
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,060
Xardas: Capitolul trei.

2
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:33,060
Reinhard: Bine ați venit la Gothic 1 Remake Podcast.

3
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:37,240
Reinhard: Suntem puțin în afara taberei vechi, în sălbăticie, stând la un foc de tabără.

4
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:43,240
Reinhard: Și suntem aici pentru a vă vorbi despre ceea ce s-a întâmplat în august în legătură cu Gothic 1 Remake.

5
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,260
Reinhard: Am avut două momente foarte importante pentru noi.

6
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:55,110
Reinhard: În primul rând, a fost lansat trailerul pentru Tabăra Veche, care a arătat atât atmosfera cât și mediul din Tabăra Veche.

7
00:00:55,110 --> 00:01:03,240
Reinhard: Și în al doilea rând, am avut un demo secret cu noi și am călătorit la Gamescom pentru a-l prezenta unor jurnaliști și streameri selectați.

8
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:09,210
Reinhard: Iar noi suntem aici pentru a vă oferi mai multe detalii și explicații despre ceea ce am arătat acolo.

9
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:18,250
Reinhard: Sunt Reinhard Pollice, director la Alkimia Interactive. Și mi se alătură câțiva dintre tovarășii mei care lucrează împreună cu mine la Gothic 1 Remake.

10
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:20,260
Reinhard: Vă rog să vă prezentați.

11
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:26,190
Joan: Bine. Ei bine, bună ziua, numele meu este Joan. Sunt designerul cinematic de la Alkimia.

12
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:31,240
Joan: Rolul meu este, în principiu, să mă ocup de toate părțile de cinematică pe care le vom avea în joc.

13
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:36,010
Joan: Totodată, trailerele de care vom avea nevoie în scopuri de marketing.

14
00:01:36,010 --> 00:01:43,260
Dani: Bine, eu sunt Dani. Eu sunt Dani Candil. Sunt directorul artistic al remake-ului Gothic.

15
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:48,160
Kai: Hei, numele meu este Kai Rosenkranz și sunt compozitor și designer de sunet.

16
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:49,280
Kai: Javi, vrei să fii următorul?

17
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:59,090
Javi: Da. Mă bucur să mă întorc aici. Și vă mulțumesc tuturor - comunității - pentru tot feedbackul pe care l-ați dat. A fost foarte frumos.

18
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:07,120
Timur: Așa că e rândul meu. Numele meu este Timur (T-Moor), sunt un mare fan Gothic și managerul comunității la Alkimia Interactive.

19
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:16,010
Reinhard: Mulțumesc. Să vorbim mai întâi despre trailerul pentru tabăra veche. (Joan: Bine.) Ce înseamnă tabăra veche pentru tine, Joan?

20
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:29,020
Joan: Pentru mine, tabăra veche este cea mai puternică amintire pe care o ai din jocul original, pentru că este primul loc în care ajungi când începi să joci.

21
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:36,140
Joan: Și personajele aveau o personalitate atât de puternică și tot, și sunt atât de dure cu tine.

22
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:44,070
Joan: Te simți cu adevărat mic acolo când joci, și cred că toată lumea își amintește cu nostalgie...

23
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:53,000
Joan: acele conversații întâmplătoare pe care le purtau NPC-urile, minerii care încercau să își repare colibele tot timpul.

24
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:58,110
Joan: Nu știu... acest fel de... da, mai ales cred că pentru mine, mai ales cred că e ceva solid, Tabăra Veche.

25
00:02:58,110 --> 00:03:01,060
Kai: A spus cineva sunet? (Joan: Da, cu siguranță.)

26
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:04,160
Kai: Mulțumesc, Joan. Este foarte drăguț din partea ta să spui asta. (Joan: Da.)

27
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:07,150
Reinhard: Așadar, ce înseamnă Tabăra Veche pentru tine, Dani?

28
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:12,100
Dani: Deci, pentru mine, tabăra veche este cea mai importantă parte a coloniei.

29
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:21,160
Dani: Adică, pentru mine, este reperul cel mai ușor de recunoscut din toată experiența Gothic, din punct de vedere al formei și recunoașterii vizuale.

30
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:27,220
Dani: E una dintre cele mai dificile părți ale jocului la care se poate lucra. E un labirint încurcat de colibe.

31
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:36,090
Dani: E de parcă... e interesant pentru că e un scenariu care este refolosit. Adică, inițial a fost o închisoare, apoi a devenit castelul lui Gomez.

32
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:43,290
Dani: Pentru mine, asta e interesant, pentru că îmi oferă, ca artist, posibilitatea de a lucra cu un nivel foarte ridicat de detaliu.

33
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:50,080
Dani: și un nivel foarte ridicat de narațiune, știi, un mediu care spune multe lucruri despre locul respectiv.

34
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:58,110
Dani: Și pentru mine, în depărtare, adică, țineți minte că primul lucru pe care îl vedeți este turnul din tabăra veche.

35
00:03:58,110 --> 00:04:01,060
Dani: Este unul dintre cele mai memorabile lucruri.

36
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:04,100
Reinhard: Și cum ați procedat cu trailerul pentru tabăra veche?

37
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:12,290
Joan: Am știut de la început că ne dorim ceva similar cu ultimul nostru trailer,

38
00:04:13,010 --> 00:04:20,040
Joan: trailerul pentru mina veche, în care camera de filmat zbura prin acel mediu și arăta viața, viața de acolo.

39
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:26,240
Joan: Așa că am vrut să facem același lucru: să arătăm viața din interiorul taberei vechi, dar am vrut să mergem cu un pas mai departe.

40
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:37,240
Joan: De aceea ne gândeam la noi moduri de a privi problema, nu? Așa că, așa cum ne place tuturor - sau, mai ales mie (râde) -, ne place un film.

41
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:44,110
Joan: Și căutam referințe acolo. Am propus să încercăm o cameră de urmărire pentru personajul principal.

42
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:54,010
Joan: O abordare "one shot", în care poți vedea filme care ne-au venit în minte, cum ar fi Goodfellas sau Birdman, chestii de genul ăsta.

43
00:04:54,010 --> 00:05:00,180
Joan: Dar am vrut să rămânem în spiritul Gothic. Așa că nu am vrut să exagerăm cu asta.

44
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:07,110
Joan: Așa că da, asta a fost prima noastră idee, să încercăm să creăm un cadru unic în care să urmărim un personaj.

45
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:16,200
Joan: Trebuia să decidem calea - care părți ale taberei voiam să le arătăm, iar la final am decis să arătăm prima intrare,

46
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:23,020
Joan: apoi unele dintre colibele în care de obicei sunt gărzi care îți cer bani în jocul original.

47
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:29,150
Joan: iar apoi Snaf, și mâncarea, și apoi arena.

48
00:05:29,170 --> 00:05:35,110
Joan: Dar da, s-a întâmplat ca această cale să fie atât de lungă din punct de vedere al timpului.

49
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:40,280
Joan: A durat cam 3 sau 4 minute pentru ca personajul să parcurgă toată zona asta.

50
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:45,270
Joan: Așa că abordarea cu un singur cadru a trebuit să fie ajustată. (râde)

51
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:53,050
Joan: And at the end we have some cuts during the walk, but I think they work pretty nicely.

52
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:57,210
Reinhard: How did you transfer the script into an actual visual?

53
00:05:57,210 --> 00:06:05,030
Joan: So after we had the idea (we decided to go for the one take approach),

54
00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:10,210
Joan: we needed one more thing, and that one thing was a story, a main character.

55
00:06:10,210 --> 00:06:13,210
Joan: We needed someone to lead this camera.

56
00:06:13,210 --> 00:06:20,040
Joan: So after we had the idea, we created a script that basically is about a digger

57
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:26,190
Joan: that stole some money from Bloodwyn, one of the wards, and then he got caught by him.

58
00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:28,100
Reinhard: So what happened next?

59
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:38,040
Joan: Next step was to create a storyboard, or: What we actually did was to create an animatic - or previsualization.

60
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:45,080
Joan: As we were working with Unreal, we were able to work with""Sequencer"" directly inside the engine

61
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:51,120
Joan: and that allowed us to have the animations already done for other purposes,

62
00:06:51,190 --> 00:07:00,090
Joan: putting them together also using some basic control rig which allows you to modify these animations

63
00:07:00,090 --> 00:07:12,170
Joan: in an easy way. With this we created our animated storyboard. Because they Old camp environment was already done when the trailer was being created.

64
00:07:12,170 --> 00:07:16,120
Joan: That allowed us to, well, basically we had everything.

65
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:23,200
Joan: We just needed to assemble this animatic and show it to the animators.

66
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:26,210
Joan: That was everything that we needed for this.

67
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:31,170
Kai: Aha. So does that mean that everything that we see in the trailer is also going to happen in the game?

68
00:07:31,170 --> 00:07:38,060
Reinhard: So, the Old Camp, as we see it in the Old Camp trailer, looks exactly the same in the game.

69
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:46,040
Reinhard: The events that happen can also happen like that, but in the game they will happen dynamically. In the trailer,

70
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:54,000
Reinhard: obviously, we set them up like in a sequence after each other, so they happened conveniently whenever we needed them.

71
00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:01,220
Reinhard: And the other thing that is totally not like that in the game is the camera sequence, which was specifically set up for the trailer.

72
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:04,060
Kai: Okay, Got it. Thank you.

73
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:06,250
Reinhard: What was your favorite scenes from the trailer?

74
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:15,240
Joan: Even though the fight scenes are very cool, my favorite scene is the Snaf part with the cauldron and everything.

75
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:23,240
Joan: Because acting is very funny, we also have a fight at the end, so I think is is super complete.

76
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:33,000
Dani: Okay. You know, when we started discussing the trailer, I mean, we decided to be, you know, to show the original spirit of Gothic.

77
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:38,160
Dani: The feeling of being there in the Old Camp. How hard it is to to be there, how rude everyone is.

78
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:44,220
Dani: But for me, the best moment, it's when Bloodwyn appears, you know, punching the guy

79
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:55,030
Dani: and saying:""Okay, you need to pay me the debts. Gomez needs your ore!"" For me this is a moment when you see, okay, this is a dangerous place.

80
00:08:55,030 --> 00:09:03,280
Dani: You should take care of your own life. So I think this for me, it's the best moment when you can see the characters moving and interacting between two characters in a complicated interaction.

81
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:08,150
Dani: So for me, this is one of the most memorable scenes for me in the trailer.

82
00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:12,250
Reinhard: (laughs) Isn't it hard to create a location with SO many similar digger huts?

83
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:15,090
Dani: That's a funny question because you know what I mean

84
00:09:15,090 --> 00:09:21,160
Dani: Gothic offers us the possibility to work manually in each one of those huts.

85
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:29,130
Dani: So, yes, we have dozens of huts, and I can assure you that each one of them is unique and specific and special.

86
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:37,010
Dani: So, yeah, it's it's a challenge because you should offer something different for each one, but at the same time they should feel integrated...

87
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:40,160
Dani: All of them should feel integrated in the same visual language.

88
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:44,210
Dani: And ... it's a very tricky part of designing the space.

89
00:09:44,210 --> 00:09:51,200
Dani: They should feel noisy, labyrinthic, intricate, they should feel dirty.

90
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:58,060
Dani: So, yeah, I mean, it's an interesting opportunity to make this labyrinthic space, but at the same time making it unique.

91
00:09:58,060 --> 00:10:01,150
Reinhard: Speaking about uniqueness, every face is unique, right?

92
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:07,240
Dani: Yeah, that's one of the biggest challenges of all this game. I mean, we design it, all of them.

93
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:12,110
Dani: I mean, we have been working ... This process started like two years ago.

94
00:10:12,130 --> 00:10:18,230
Dani: We started designing manually each one of the characters and we have been working together with our

95
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:25,270
Dani: I can say, I mean, we have been spending so many hours with them that I can say they are brothers and sisters of Gate 21. They are helping us a lot on that.

96
00:10:25,270 --> 00:10:34,220
Dani: And we are creating, we are trying, we're aiming to create I don't know how many characters we have, maybe 600 or something like that, (Joan: Yep!) unique specific characters.

97
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:41,080
Dani: So we can create unique characters and then we can mix them and blend them and creating new characters again.

98
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:48,030
Dani: So yeah, we are - I mean - we are hoping and trying super hard to make this the experience that the Gothic fans deserve.

99
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:57,280
Dani: I mean, in Gothic, I remember playing the original Gothic, everyone, every character felt original, right? Unique! So we are aiming for the same.

100
00:10:57,280 --> 00:11:00,080
Reinhard: That's great. Thanks for the insight. (Dani: Thank you.)

101
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:06,040
Reinhard: Is there anything you would like to change on the trailer if you could go back?

102
00:11:06,070 --> 00:11:19,150
Joan: If I had the chance to come back, I think I will try to revise a bit the first part of the trailer. Maybe ... there's many things happening at the same time. (Reinhard: Yeah.)

103
00:11:19,210 --> 00:11:27,050
Joan: We could try a better way to introduce the trailer, but overall, I think it's working good.

104
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:29,090
Kai: Oh yeah, I absolutely think it does.

105
00:11:29,090 --> 00:11:36,120
Kai: Although I think we should address the fact that everybody in the trailer speaks Cockney British now. Why is that?

106
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:43,290
Reinhard: So we decided to go with the rough atmosphere, we take the Cockney accent in English, but not everybody has the same accent.

107
00:11:43,290 --> 00:11:54,020
Reinhard: Some people come from different parts of Myrtana and so they speak, differently, like Diego who has a very different accent and not the rough Cockney accent.

108
00:11:54,020 --> 00:12:05,230
Reinhard: So I would say: Yes, the Old Camp will sound rough and will sound very cockney, but overall it is not even more than 50%. (Kai: Okay, cool.)

109
00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:08,050
Kai: Thanks for clarifying that.

110
00:12:08,070 --> 00:12:14,030
Reinhard: Alright. Since we're sitting here at the campfire, we obviously also need to eat something.

111
00:12:14,030 --> 00:12:19,260
Reinhard: I'm going to eat Swampshark Poke. What can I serve you?

112
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:20,220
Timur: Thanks, Reinhard.

113
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:27,170
Kai: Yeah, thank you. But actually, you can continue chatting and I'll take care of taking the orders and preparing the meals. (Reinhard: Thanks.)

114
00:12:27,170 --> 00:12:28,180
Kai: Timur, what's your choice?

115
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:34,090
Timur: I think my favorite one is Bartholos Roasted Scavenger Steak with barbecue sauce.

116
00:12:34,090 --> 00:12:38,130
Timur: And to drink, I would like the Rice Lord's vodka.

117
00:12:38,130 --> 00:12:43,180
Kai: Okay, Rice Lord's vodka. Alright! So Javi, what will you have?

118
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:47,250
Javi: I will go with Roasted Scavenger and a bottle of beer.

119
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:50,220
Kai: Yeah, it's going to be the same for me! Dani?

120
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:56,020
Dani: Well, Meatbug Paella with Rice Lord's special. That would be nice.

121
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:59,090
Kai: One more from the Rice Lord. Okay! Joan, your turn.

122
00:12:59,090 --> 00:13:04,120
Joan: What about Swampshark Grilled Fillet? S'il vous plaît.

123
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:07,060
Kai: Mais oui, bien sûr! And for drink?

124
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:12,060
Joan: Yeah, and for drink maybe some vegetable juice that we can find around here.

125
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:13,240
Kai: Okay. Working on it.

126
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:18,290
Reinhard: Now, let's talk about the Nyras Prolog, which was the demo that we showed to press and streamers at Gamescom.

127
00:13:18,290 --> 00:13:23,230
Kai: Yeah, actually, I think that needs some more introduction. (Reinhard: Yes.) So what is the ... What is it?

128
00:13:23,230 --> 00:13:35,070
Reinhard: So, the Nyras Prolog is really a slice of the game that contains almost all elements in a close to final form, and it features not the nameless hero, but the character called Nyras.

129
00:13:35,070 --> 00:13:46,210
Reinhard: And we chose this because the start of the game is not really something that has a big - like - progression curve, because it expects you to go to the Old Camp and do some talking there.

130
00:13:46,210 --> 00:13:55,010
Reinhard: Our goal was that within 30 minutes you get to see every element of the game and we could achieve this with this setup. (Kai: Yeah, that makes a lot of sense.)

131
00:13:55,010 --> 00:13:59,140
Kai: The first food's ready. Ehm, Paella was for you, Dani, right? (Dani: Exactly, yes!)

132
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:04,060
Kai: There you go. (Dani: Thanks.) Reinhard, why did we choose Nyras for the prolog?

133
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:12,200
Reinhard: We had obviously several options because before the Nameless Hero gets sent into the colony, obviously other characters get sent into the colony.

134
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:21,010
Reinhard: (Kai talking to others in the background, giving out food and drinks.) Reinhard: And so it was a guy named Nyras that later turned his attention to the swamp and plays a very important part later down the road in the game.

135
00:14:21,050 --> 00:14:25,130
Kai: Cool. Thank you. Here's your meal. (Reinhard: Thanks.) That should be everything.

136
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:29,110
Reinhard: So what was the main goal of the Nyras Prolog and how did we start?

137
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:40,130
Javi: Well, I think our main goal was to show all the progress of the game and a little bit how the game has changed from the PT - from the playable teaser.

138
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:57,150
Javi: So we have a lot of things to show, and one of the more important things that we wanted to show was the Exchange Zone at the end, because it changed a lot from the previous version we had done. This limit of the level, the space, and we build from there.

139
00:14:57,170 --> 00:14:59,140
Javi: There are a lot of things that we want to show there.

140
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:05,030
Javi: Well, we can talk about all the mechanics or systems.

141
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:08,150
Javi: I don't know which one do you want to start talking about?

142
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:12,000
Reinhard: I think we should start exactly with that. The Exchange Zone.

143
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,300
Reinhard: So is it a completely new exchange zone?

144
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:17,000
Javi: Well, it's pretty much the same.

145
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:24,180
Javi: I think all the players will recognize it. It's the place they imagine, like a new version but the same place.

146
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:39,120
Javi: (Dani: Yeah.) We want to build from the original. We have created this Exchange Zone where - well - in the prolog Whistler and Diego were there. And we keep most of the rhythm of the level.

147
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:43,140
Javi: We keep the abandoned mine entrance, the bridge...

148
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:47,250
Javi: Well, I think all the players will recognize it perfectly. (Dani: Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.)

149
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:57,090
Javi: Yeah, we have these, these different areas that we work with. Because we have also the top area where - you know - all the players remember there was there Goblin in there.

150
00:15:57,090 --> 00:16:01,210
Javi: We have also the tree with the Scavengers and... Yeah!

151
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:10,280
Javi: From our level perspective we keep the same and we want to show it and create a story for the beginning of any prisoner when they go inside the colony.

152
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:13,210
Reinhard: Cool. So what was the process?

153
00:16:13,210 --> 00:16:27,150
Javi: Well, from the level perspective, what we create is taking the original, we create a blockout and we try to keep as much as possible (true) to the original one.

154
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:35,170
Javi: But also we want to improve it, giving these areas more... more deepness and more flavor for what they are, really.

155
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:46,080
Javi: And then we talk with the art team when we have this blockout to start working on the - okay - the decoration, the framing, more stuff in a in a visual way.

156
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:51,020
Javi: Also we..., when we are doing these blockouts, we also thought about the

157
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:53,110
Javi: the creatures who are there. Because for us it's very important

158
00:16:53,110 --> 00:16:59,240
Javi: to create this habitat for the creatures. Like where they live, where they sleep, where they eat,

159
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:03,010
Javi: how is their daily routine also for the creatures? Because at the end

160
00:17:03,010 --> 00:17:09,150
Javi: they are living creatures also. And, and yeah, and also one of the of the important things for for this

161
00:17:09,150 --> 00:17:23,270
Javi: prolog is to create this pacing for the quests. But it's also very important for us, for when we create a space, we have also in mind the quest that will be there and... Yeah, that's our process.

162
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:32,090
Javi: We create this, we place the people, we try it, we iterate, we talk with the art team, they create awesome visuals for these spaces.

163
00:17:32,090 --> 00:17:39,070
Javi: And yeah, it's something like... We start from from the blockout and from there we continue with, with all these things.

164
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:43,240
Dani: Yeah. The cool thing is that when we start preparing the blockout phase,

165
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:49,020
Dani: I mean, we meet together with the designers, with the level designers, so we can share the same vision

166
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:55,020
Dani: about how this space should be explored, how this a space should look and feel.

167
00:17:55,050 --> 00:17:59,260
Dani: So when they give the blockout to us, we are basically working on the same page.

168
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:04,130
Dani: So we start our process of, you know, searching for believable environments.

169
00:18:04,130 --> 00:18:11,020
Dani: I mean, we should transform this blockout into believable environments, into believable constructions.

170
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:16,190
Dani: So we'll start, you know, drawing and sketching and searching for references.

171
00:18:16,190 --> 00:18:20,290
Dani: It's super important to always search for realistic references.

172
00:18:20,290 --> 00:18:26,210
Dani: And we start playing with materials and trying to create the right sensation, the right mood, the right structures.

173
00:18:26,210 --> 00:18:30,130
Dani: And sometimes we go a little overboard with the details.

174
00:18:30,130 --> 00:18:36,190
Dani: But in general, the cool thing is that here we work together as a great team. We share the same vision.

175
00:18:36,190 --> 00:18:42,150
Dani: So basically when we start decorating, we already know how this should end up looking.

176
00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:44,140
Reinhard: That's great. Thanks for the insight.

177
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:48,180
Reinhard: The changed Exchange Zone does have a new fireplace right? (Javi: Right.)

178
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:56,020
Javi: This fire point in the Exchange Zone that we placed there for the players to be able to cook some recipes.

179
00:18:56,030 --> 00:19:00,120
Javi: There are a lot of creatures in the Exchange Zone that give you meat.

180
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:03,250
Javi: Like the Scavengers and the Molerats also.

181
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:11,050
Javi: But this is one of our bases. Because we want the player to get this meat and prepare the recipes, the dishes.

182
00:19:11,050 --> 00:19:13,120
Javi: And it's a way to survive in the wildlands.

183
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:20,230
Javi: Also we are having a lot of interest in developing better the hunting skills because it's something

184
00:19:20,230 --> 00:19:24,290
Javi: that we think is important for the game because at the end you are in the wildlands, you need to survive.

185
00:19:24,290 --> 00:19:27,130
Javi: You need to get these material from the creatures.

186
00:19:27,130 --> 00:19:33,130
Javi: And for us, it's very, very important to give this feeling of adventure of... Okay, you have to get prepared with this.

187
00:19:33,150 --> 00:19:42,070
Javi: And we will use these materials for many kinds of crafting because we will have not just cooking, we will have more crafting there.

188
00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:47,250
Javi: Yeah, it's something important for us and we will give this a little bit more and land

189
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:52,030
Javi: because at the end you can prepare different dishes with different materials.

190
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:58,160
Kai: And I got to say: The way it is executed in the Nyras Prolog, the cooking mechanic, already works very well. (Javi: Yes.)

191
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:01,280
Kai: Why did we choose the Exchange Zone for the demo ground?

192
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:07,160
Reinhard: Using the exchange zone as the scenery for the Prolog was a natural choice because it can

193
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:13,070
Reinhard: very well be separated from the rest of the world and doesn't need to get borders everywhere.

194
00:20:13,070 --> 00:20:18,010
Reinhard: It already has very natural borders, almost anywhere other than in the mountain path.

195
00:20:18,010 --> 00:20:24,130
Reinhard: So we only had to find an explanation of why this path is blocked. (Kai: And what is that explanation?)

196
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:31,210
Reinhard: So, the setup was that the rockslide happened and rocks were basically blocking the way down.

197
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:38,280
Reinhard: And since there were people kind of like busy with some dealings in there, they are now trapped in this environment.

198
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:41,120
Kai: Yeah, yeah, I guess that works.

199
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:43,250
Reinhard: Joan, you were an important part of that.

200
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:48,050
Reinhard: You contributed the concept of the cinematic camera system.

201
00:20:48,050 --> 00:20:55,210
Joan: Yeah. Well, I think the challenge for the cinematic dialogs that we wanted to have was specially... Normally in cinema,

202
00:20:55,240 --> 00:21:01,010
Joan: when you have a shot-by-shot situation, you also have an editing, right?

203
00:21:01,010 --> 00:21:10,040
Joan: (Kai: Yes.) An editing that has some sense and reasons inside the cinematic rules that we all know.

204
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:16,120
Joan: So for us, this was the main challenge because we wanted to have

205
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:22,020
Joan: a lot of diferent cameras as you can experience in cinema, not just two or three.

206
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:29,020
Joan: And at the end this was difficult to achieve, even though for the game we are going to have it!

207
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:36,070
Joan: But for the demo we did some tests and finally to achieve the quality that we wanted to achieve,

208
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:42,010
Joan: we needed to cut the idea and we have have, I think, two or three cameras for the demo.

209
00:21:42,010 --> 00:21:51,160
Joan: But also when we were doing our research, looking into other third person RPG games for inspiration,

210
00:21:51,180 --> 00:22:00,110
Joan: we noticed that maybe the most important thing for... for the dialog scenes to look cinematic was the light.

211
00:22:00,130 --> 00:22:01,020
Dani: Exactly. Yes.

212
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:07,090
Joan: We discovered that in most of these games add new lights when the dialog starts.

213
00:22:07,110 --> 00:22:12,090
Joan: And for us, this was key. So that was another thing that we needed to add

214
00:22:12,090 --> 00:22:18,090
Joan: on top of the cameras in order to achieve a super nice cinematic dialogs.

215
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:21,010
Joan: So now we are working hard on that.

216
00:22:21,010 --> 00:22:30,280
Joan: We are designing our systems in order to achieve this. And yeah, I hope you like it in the final game.

217
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:35,210
Reinhard: Yes! So the Nyras demo contains a slice of everything - and for the first time also the UI, right?

218
00:22:35,210 --> 00:22:44,030
Javi: Right! And for us is very important to show it. Because one of the most important things

219
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:47,220
Javi: from Gothic is immersion, and we want to keep the immersion very clear.

220
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:53,220
Javi: We don't want to have these full screen menus that doesn't allow to to continue playing.

221
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:56,010
Javi: Instead, checking your inventory is part of the game.

222
00:22:56,010 --> 00:23:01,040
Javi: You cannot just pause the game and check what you have. It's in the middle of the game. You can do it close to an enemy,

223
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:06,200
Javi: but it's on your own risk. And also, well - we give a review to it.

224
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:10,120
Javi: But yeah, we have this in mind. That's something very important from the original.

225
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:16,160
Javi: Like, we don't want to have a lot of numbers or text or health bars in the middle of the screens.

226
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:20,090
Javi: We want to keep it as clean as possible and it's something that I want to show in the prolog.

227
00:23:20,090 --> 00:23:26,290
Kai: That's great. One thing we haven't yet talked about is combat!

228
00:23:26,290 --> 00:23:32,130
Kai: The Nyras Prolog also had - like - a first iteration of the new combat system. (Javi: Yes, exactly.)

229
00:23:32,130 --> 00:23:35,000
Reinhard: So how did you get the combat to work?

230
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:40,180
Javi: Yeah. For the combat, what's also something very important for us to show to the audience

231
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:45,180
Javi: was the gestures, the postures for the combat, the stance.

232
00:23:45,180 --> 00:23:50,090
Javi: I mean, like... we want the player to know that at the beginning it would be rough!

233
00:23:50,090 --> 00:23:54,000
Javi: You would not be a master with the sword or even with the pickaxe,

234
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:58,070
Javi: because one of the first weapons you can find in the Exchange Zone is a pickaxe.

235
00:23:58,070 --> 00:24:02,000
Javi: So for us it's a challenge to make this, but I think we accomplish it.

236
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,150
Javi: Because the player can start fighting,

237
00:24:04,150 --> 00:24:09,110
Javi: they movement is not feeling as good as you think, because you are watching a non-specialist warrior.

238
00:24:09,110 --> 00:24:12,280
Javi: You're watching a... just a prisoner in the colony. And also, in the prolog

239
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:21,000
Javi: we work to have this combat versus Kirgo and you can learn combat from him and he will teach you...

240
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:27,270
Javi: Okay, this is how you can use a one-handed weapon and then you evolve as a... as a fighter.

241
00:24:27,290 --> 00:24:32,240
Javi: And yeah, these's a lot of things, because also we have these special movesets for different kinds of weapons.

242
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:37,070
Javi: It's not the same for a mace, a sword, an axe.

243
00:24:37,070 --> 00:24:40,170
Javi: And of course, for all (two weapons) ... two-handed weapons.

244
00:24:40,170 --> 00:24:44,010
Javi: So we wanted to show all these evolutions for all these kinds of weapons.

245
00:24:44,010 --> 00:24:47,220
Javi: And it's a challenge, but I think it feels really, really good at the hands

246
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:50,210
Javi: when you are a beginner with a weapon and you...

247
00:24:50,210 --> 00:24:54,120
Javi: and you start to know how to fight. Because we want to keep the game

248
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:58,250
Javi: as relying on the ability of the player, but also it's an RPG.

249
00:24:58,250 --> 00:25:02,030
Javi: So you have to learn how to use a weapon. (Kai: Yeah.)

250
00:25:02,030 --> 00:25:07,150
Kai: And so many people out there wanted to see the new combat system in action.

251
00:25:07,150 --> 00:25:10,270
Kai: Why haven't we shown any gameplay to the public audience yet?

252
00:25:10,270 --> 00:25:13,250
Reinhard: So we showed some screenshots of what we presented.

253
00:25:13,250 --> 00:25:16,130
Reinhard: They were 1-to-1 from this prolog.

254
00:25:16,130 --> 00:25:22,240
Reinhard: There are some things where we didn't achieve the quality that we wanted to achieve or

255
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:29,050
Reinhard: contained some bugs or unpolished things, and we don't want to overshadow the public opinion by that.

256
00:25:29,070 --> 00:25:35,290
Reinhard: So we chose to not release any footage to the public. But we'll have later down the road a real gameplay reveal

257
00:25:36,010 --> 00:25:39,270
Reinhard: where people get to see unedited gameplay of the Gothic 1 Remake.

258
00:25:39,270 --> 00:25:42,150
Dani: So, Reinhard, what is going to happen with the Nyras Prolog?

259
00:25:42,150 --> 00:25:47,150
Reinhard: So, we haven't really decided what will happen with the Nyras Prolog.

260
00:25:47,150 --> 00:25:48,280
Reinhard: We have this done now.

261
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:54,230
Reinhard: We're working on that there's some things will be improved because we improve them for the game anyways.

262
00:25:54,230 --> 00:26:00,230
Reinhard: There are several options. One could be a public release, and one could actually be... well...

263
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:09,090
Reinhard: as a kind of like a special data sample that is living in the game and can be accessed somehow.

264
00:26:09,110 --> 00:26:11,230
Kai: Okay, you're making a big secret out of it.

265
00:26:11,230 --> 00:26:18,100
Reinhard: Yeah, it's cool. And I don't like to make big promises, you know me! (Kai: Fair enough.)

266
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:21,080
Kai: Better this way than the other way around.

267
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:26,220
Reinhard: Yeah. Over the history of the Gothic franchise, we know how big promises end, right?

268
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:29,190
Everyone: Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. Very true.

269
00:26:29,190 --> 00:26:33,180
Kai: Alright, so... almost half an hour. What else do we have to talk about?

270
00:26:33,180 --> 00:26:38,240
Timur: I have some questions from our community. (Kai: Oh yeah, yeah. Great!) Let's go through some of them.

271
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:40,240
Kai: Okay. Sounds good.

272
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:46,230
Timur: So, the question with the most upvotes was from a user with the nickname Shaolyn:

273
00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:56,190
Timur: ""Will the game have mod support for the modding community to create them easily and for community content to be added over the years? And will there be a marvin mode?"" (submitted by Shaolyn)

274
00:26:56,190 --> 00:27:00,130
Reinhard: So mod support is actually something really important to us.

275
00:27:00,130 --> 00:27:05,140
Reinhard: We understand there's a big community creating mods since many, many years.

276
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:14,080
Reinhard: In fact, around 20 years ago I used to create my own mods for gothic, but we have some limitation to fight with.

277
00:27:14,110 --> 00:27:18,220
Reinhard: We work with Unreal Engine and Unreal Engine is not the best engine for modding.

278
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:25,100
Reinhard: But anyways, we found a pretty cool way where we can expose something like a scripting language to players

279
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:28,060
Reinhard: and they can just toy around with that.

280
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:35,180
Reinhard: About the marvin mode: Yeah, I mean there are some sort of debug commands. We'll see.

281
00:27:35,180 --> 00:27:37,150
Timur: Yeah. Thank you, Shaolyn, for your question.

282
00:27:37,150 --> 00:27:43,100
Timur: And the second question is from a very active Discord member: Asnen.

283
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:56,260
Timur: And the question is:""What motivated the significant changes in the appearance of monsters in the Gothic Remake in comparison to the original in terms of your art direction choices?"". Asnen, thank you for your question.

284
00:27:56,290 --> 00:28:00,080
Timur: Oh, maybe this question is for you, Dani.

285
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:04,230
Dani: Well, that's a tricky question. And of course there's not a simple answer to that.

286
00:28:04,230 --> 00:28:10,150
Dani: But when you are redesigning creatures, monsters that were designed more than 20 years ago,

287
00:28:10,150 --> 00:28:16,040
Dani: you are facing some esthetic decisions, technical limitations that maybe were valid then,

288
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:20,010
Dani: but maybe they can feel a little outdated now.

289
00:28:20,010 --> 00:28:24,040
Dani: This is one part of the answer: the evolution of the esthetics and technique,

290
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:27,180
Dani: the way we can render creatures now, technically and artistically

291
00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:30,140
Dani: that wasn't possible back then gives you the opportunity

292
00:28:30,140 --> 00:28:35,010
Dani: to go deep into the original designs and make them evolve and going the extra mile.

293
00:28:35,010 --> 00:28:41,240
Dani: But having said that, we designed the creatures trying to find the sweet spot between three main vectors:

294
00:28:41,270 --> 00:28:47,120
Dani: 1: The principles of evolutionary biology, especially thinking in the adaptations.

295
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:51,200
Dani: I mean - by""adaptations"" I mean those features that have evolved in the species

296
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:55,060
Dani: over time in response to specific environmental pressures

297
00:28:55,060 --> 00:29:02,190
Dani: that provide some functional advantage for them. 2: Adding to that mix a controlled amount of fantasy.

298
00:29:02,210 --> 00:29:05,260
Dani: So essentially the creatures should feel believable,

299
00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:11,000
Dani: believable inside the world of Gothic, that in essence is a dark medieval tale.

300
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:18,110
Dani: And 3: Those two previous vectors should go toe to toe with the original idea behind the original designs.

301
00:29:18,130 --> 00:29:20,140
Dani: So we can change a little the look of a creature,

302
00:29:20,140 --> 00:29:27,030
Dani: but once you see it moving and behaving in a world, we are confident you will recognize it immediately.

303
00:29:27,050 --> 00:29:28,240
Timur: Thanks, Dani.

304
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:31,060
Timur: So the question number three is from Jasoon.

305
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:43,280
Timur: ""How much do you plan to expand the plot on the Nameless One's four friends: Diego, Milten, Gorn and Lester? For example, their past, their own side quests, greater involvement in the story."" (submitted by Jasoon)

306
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:45,090
Reinhard: That's a really good question.

307
00:29:45,090 --> 00:29:51,070
Reinhard: So for us, the Four Friends is some of the lasting moments of the Gothic series, I think.

308
00:29:51,070 --> 00:29:55,160
Reinhard: But in fact it didn't receive such a proper introduction.

309
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:59,060
Reinhard: So this is definitely something that we want to provide something better.

310
00:29:59,060 --> 00:30:05,200
Reinhard: And a good moment where all four of them with the hero are together and having to solve something.

311
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:12,200
Reinhard: And besides that, I mean, yes, there will be a more in-depth background stories for those four friends.

312
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:16,150
Timur: Thanks, Reinhard, and thanks Jasoon for your question.

313
00:30:16,150 --> 00:30:20,000
Timur: And the last question is from user Xardosh.

314
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:27,290
Timur: ""Do we have a way to customize the nameless hero like a head shave or tattoos, for example, after joining the sect camp?"" (submitted by Xardosh)

315
00:30:28,010 --> 00:30:33,050
Kai: I think I can answer this one. (Timur: Xardosh, thank you for your question!) Yeah, thank you.

316
00:30:33,050 --> 00:30:36,270
Kai: So this one is very easy to answer because it's a no.

317
00:30:36,270 --> 00:30:41,190
Kai: There's no such thing as customization for the Nameless Hero planned.

318
00:30:41,190 --> 00:30:44,030
Timur: Yeah. Thanks everyone, for sending your questions.

319
00:30:44,030 --> 00:30:47,000
Timur: We will try to answer the rest of them in later episodes.

320
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:50,020
Reinhard: Okay, let's wrap it up. That's it.

321
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:53,020
Reinhard: Thanks for joining us on this campfire chat.

322
00:30:53,020 --> 00:31:01,220
Reinhard: We hope we gave you some additional insights into how we created the Nyras Prolog and the Old Camp trailer.

323
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:09,210
Reinhard: We look forward to have you on the next regular episode of the Gothic 1 Remake Podcast and bring you some more news about Gothic.
