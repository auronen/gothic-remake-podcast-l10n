00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:24,000
Xardas: Kapitola Druhá

2
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:35,230
Kai: Ahoj, všichni, a vítejte u Gothic Remake Podcastu. Já jsem Kai Rosenkranz, skladatel a zvukový designer.

3
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:42,180
Reinhard: A já jsem Reinhard Pollice, režisér studia a hry. Vítejte ve starém táboře. Pojďme se projít k aréně.

4
00:00:42,290 --> 00:00:44,000
Kai: Dobrá.

5
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,150
Reinhard: Diego! Oh, wow. Jak se sem dostal tak rychle?

6
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:54,040
Kai: Znovu tě zdravím, Diego. [Ahoj.] Doufám že se ti líbí nová hudba pro tvůj tábor.

7
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:57,040
Sprecher 1: Dobrá práce. To není špatné na nováčka.

8
00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:05,010
Kai: Děkuju ti, Diego. Já tenhle tábor tak miluju. Ten šmrnc, nostalgie, ta blátivá vůně.

9
00:01:05,210 --> 00:01:09,010
Reinhard: To je pravděpodobně jen zasedací místnost, ve které nahráváme epizodu.

10
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:14,000
Kai: Jo, možná. Ale pšššt, narušuješ atmosféru.

11
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,220
Reinhard: Každopádně... Vítejte všichni u druhé epizody o principech designu.

12
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:21,150
Kai: And by""design principles"" you mean what?

13
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:31,110
Reinhard: Well, the fundamental principles underneath all of our design choices and ideas. The grand vision, the Ten Commandments that we apply to everything we do.

14
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:36,050
Kai: Ooh, wow. The very foundation. That's a big subject.

15
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:37,220
Reinhard: I guess you asked for it.

16
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:45,200
Kai: Talking about foundations... are these guys over there building the stage? [Yes.] Wait, does that mean concert confirmed?

17
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:51,170
Reinhard: Well, we can't talk about that right now. We feel like this should be one, though.

18
00:01:52,090 --> 00:02:03,120
Kai: Oh, yes, absolutely. The whole old camp theme was based on""Hermannelig"", an old folk song performed by In Extremo. It would be a blast to have a performance of that song on that stage again.

19
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:07,050
Reinhard: Absolutely. But let's talk about that another time.

20
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:08,090
Kai: Okay.

21
00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:14,020
Kai: Why are we going this way? The arena is the other way around the outer ring.

22
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:21,290
Reinhard: You're absolutely right. But we'll have to pick someone up at the south entrance. And here we have a bit more time to chat before we get there.

23
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:26,120
Kai: Ah, nice. Are we meeting the person you have to give that letter to?

24
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:34,000
Reinhard: Well, not right now. We're going to meet Javi Untoria, our lead game designer, at the south entrance. But the letter is not for him.

25
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:46,150
Kai: Okay, I see. Folks in the outer ring seem to be pretty busy already. Can you talk a little bit about their daily routines and how we're breathing life into this place and its inhabitants? Or would you like to leave that for Javi?

26
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:56,050
Reinhard: No, no, that's fine. We can talk about it right now. We set out to create a really believable daily schedule, so they will do actions depending on what time of day it is.

27
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:59,120
Kyle: How often have I told you bastards not to run through my hut?

28
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,090
Reinhard: Sorry, Kyle. We're just...

29
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:15,190
Kyle: Leave me alone, man. [Alright, we'll just...] Don't build your hut close to the ditch, they said. But none of these bastards told me what would happen if I still did it. When I came back from the mine a few days ago, I had a second door.

30
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:18,000
Reinhard: And that's exactly what we're going through.

31
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:22,160
Kyle: Those pigs. I hate them. I can't tell you how much I hate them.

32
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:24,230
Kai: Uhm... bye, Kyle. I'll see you later.

33
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:27,030
Sprecher 1: Now everybody runs to my hut.

34
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:32,240
Kai: Poor guy. [Every idiot.] Shouldn't we move his hut away from the path in the remake?

35
00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:36,130
Reinhard: Ha! Of course not.

36
00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:38,150
Kai: I just hope we won't run into...

37
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:41,160
Mud: Hey, man, new here? I haven't seen you before.

38
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:42,180
Kai: Oh, no.

39
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,090
Mud: I'll join you for a while, if you don't mind. I'm sure you'll need a friend.

40
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:52,000
Kai: Hey, Mud. Sorry, but we're in a little rush. We're g...

41
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,260
Mud: Tell me! Where are we going? Or is it supposed to be a surprise? Hehe, I like surprises.

42
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Reinhard: Mud, you have to go to the stage construction site and help them out, okay? The stage builders said they need your help or they won't be able to finish the stage in time, so.

43
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:15,050
Mud: So they'll finally understand that they were wrong about me. That'll be fun. [Yeah.] The others only want to get rid of me all the time.

44
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:17,080
Reinhard: Uhm... yeah. We have to go now, buddy.

45
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:22,060
Mud: Now I'm going to tell them a few of things. I'll think of a plan.

46
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:24,210
Kai: Aaaw, that was so nice of you.

47
00:04:24,290 --> 00:04:28,150
Reinhard: Well, I'm gonna have to give the stage builders a massive pay rise.

48
00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:47,270
Kai: I guess so. You said we'll meet Javi by the south entrance, right? [Yep.] Okay. That gives us a few minutes. Some screenshots of the old camp have already been published, and they were received very well. I can confirm that it looks even better when you're strolling around in it. But I have a question about lighting and colors. [Sure.]

49
00:04:48,120 --> 00:05:05,150
Kai: It's good to see everything's less colorful and vivid compared to the Playable Teaser. And also I've noticed that it's not as brightly lit as the screenshots that you've published. To me, when I looked at those screenshots last year, the sunlight looked kind of too brutal and it bleached out most of the colors. But this looks much more balanced.

50
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:13,060
Kai: The lighting is much smoother and also it preserves some of the colors that were in the old camp, but still maintaining that brownish, dusty vibe.

51
00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:17,080
Reinhard: Yes, we want it to really create this rough and dark atmosphere.

52
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:18,090
Kai: Mmm. I see.

53
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:20,270
Reinhard: There he is. Hello, Javi.

54
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:23,110
Javi: Hey, Reinhard, and hi, Kai.

55
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:25,200
Kai: Javi, so nice to see you.

56
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:28,000
Javi: You too. Shall we head to the arena?

57
00:05:28,130 --> 00:05:29,090
Reinhard: Yes, please.

58
00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:32,020
Kai: So you're the lead game designer at Alkimia?

59
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:32,170
Javi: Yes.

60
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:35,210
Kai: Wow. Thanks for joining us. What do you do exactly?

61
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:47,090
Javi: My job is to manage the design and level design team. I am in charge of helping the team to maintain a coherent vision and oversee their work. Also, I design some complex system and coordinate with other teams.

62
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:55,170
Kai: Cool. Are you getting input or - like - guidance or maybe direction from someone above you? Or do you have the last word on design decisions?

63
00:05:55,230 --> 00:06:04,030
Javi: We have clear guidelines of what Gothic is and what Gothic is not. But in the most controversial issues the game director has the last word.

64
00:06:04,170 --> 00:06:06,170
Kai: And the game director is Reinhard, right?

65
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:08,200
Javi: Yep, he is.

66
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:17,150
Javi: Look, there is Huno the blacksmith, preparing his smithy for the remake. Would you like to learn a little bit about forging weapons?

67
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:18,240
Kai: Absolutely.

68
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:25,120
Reinhard: Hey, Huno, can you give us a quick presentation of how you go about forging weapons in the remake? Or would that take too long?

69
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:29,100
Huno: That depends. I'm as fast as a hurricane with simple swords.

70
00:06:29,210 --> 00:06:36,190
Reinhard: Nice. A simple sword will do, thanks. You do your thing and Javi can explain a bit about the new forging mechanics.

71
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:51,260
Javi: A fantastic thing about Gothic is that you could make your own sword by going through the whole forging process step by step. We will keep that for sure! But we want to take it further, and the player will be able to forge more types of weapons. No, just the simple sword.

72
00:06:52,090 --> 00:06:57,180
Kai: Thank you for the insight, Javi, and thanks, Huno, for your time. Hope we didn't badger you for too long.

73
00:06:57,270 --> 00:06:59,230
Huno: Nah, on the contrary.

74
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:14,110
Kai: He's always so polite. Just as I remember him. *Laughing* Wow! The arena looks massive. The screenshots already revealed that it got scaled up and extended, but it looks even bigger when you're approaching it.

75
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:17,180
Javi: Yes. We have expanded the arena and its role in the camp.

76
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:20,030
Kai: Ah. How exactly?

77
00:07:20,170 --> 00:07:40,110
Javi: Well, the arena is the only way for the colony inhabitants to have fun. We want to give it a more important role, when even the ore barons come out from the castle to watch the fights. [M-hm.] We would like to add more quest and content around the arena, and not just limit ourselves to the few 1 vs.1 fights like in the original.

78
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:53,030
Javi: For this, we need to expand it and create a focus on the camp. It's still the remains of a building for fighting, but now more people can come and fight. It can't just be limited to some fighters.

79
00:07:53,170 --> 00:07:56,190
Kai: Interesting. So who's going to fight in the arena?

80
00:07:56,260 --> 00:08:04,110
Javi: There are many warriors in the colony who'd like to test their skill, as well as some terrifying creatures that many barons would like to see fight.

81
00:08:04,290 --> 00:08:08,170
Kai: Okay. Wow. That was pretty detailed. Thank you so much.

82
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:09,200
Javi: You are welcome.

83
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:13,240
Reinhard: Are you guys hungry? Snaf's crew cantina should be open.

84
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:15,010
Kai: Good ol' Snaf?

85
00:08:15,130 --> 00:08:16,010
Javi: Sounds good.

86
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:19,290
Kai: Yeah, it does. Will he serve the original meatbug ragout?

87
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:26,130
Reinhard: He will in the remake! But for us, he's making a huge paella. The studio is based in Spain, after all.

88
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:29,300
Javi: Oh, wait. Mud is speaking with Snaf.

89
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:33,210
Reinhard: Mud? Shouldn't he be on the other side of the camp helping to stage builders?

90
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:36,230
Kai: I don't know. My gut feeling tells me they sent him away.

91
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:39,180
Mud: Got something to eat for me? [Here.] Great.

92
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:41,160
Reinhard: Hey, Snaf.

93
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:43,110
Snaf: Hey. What'll it be?

94
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:47,120
Reinhard: Can we have three portions of your paella?

95
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:50,200
Snaf: Alright. Here! You can try a portion right away.

96
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:54,200
Kai: I'll take it. Thank you. Mmmmh.

97
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:57,220
Snaf: What do you think? [That's really good.] Excellent.

98
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,100
Reinhard: Thanks.

99
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:09,200
Javi: To be clear: Snaf, in the remake, you will be serving your beloved meatbug ragout. Not paella, right? [Exactly.]

100
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Kai: So no changes here. Just mushrooms and meatbugs? [I didn't say that.] Hmm.

101
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,180
Kai: So, Reinhard said, this episode will be about design principles.

102
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:24,180
Javi: Yes, I heard that, too.

103
00:09:26,010 --> 00:09:29,080
Kai: That sounds like exactly the kind of topic we should ask YOU about, Javi.

104
00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:32,100
Javi: I might know a thing or two about it. Yes.

105
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:38,110
Kai: Excellent. Elaborate, please. What are the design principles you've established for the remake?

106
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:44,210
Javi: We have a very clear basis for the game. We will talk about the three main concept.

107
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:45,210
Kai: M-hm, okay.

108
00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:51,270
Javi: First, the player can choose how to play. We have to give them options and different playstyles.

109
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:52,190
Reinhard: Oh, yeah.

110
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:53,230
Kai: Yeah. Sounds good.

111
00:09:54,140 --> 00:10:01,080
Javi: Two: The world is alive. We are not looking for something scripted. We want something systemic that the player can interact with.

112
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,030
Kai: Oh, yes. Very important.

113
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:20,120
Javi: Yes. And the third pillar is:""Immersion is essential"". We don't want to guide the player with obligatory tutorials, but reward the player to discover and explore the world. We know this can be a little bit harsh at the beginning, but it's the Gothic experience.

114
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:28,220
Kai: Yes, it is. That's very interesting. So what's your process when you evaluate new design ideas? How do you make sure they match the principles?

115
00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:42,180
Javi: When we design something new or work in our redesign, we always confront it with the pillars as a validation that we are on the right track. In fact, in design, we tend to close the issue with""this is very Gothic"".

116
00:10:43,130 --> 00:11:05,200
Kai: Okay, here's a question very closely related to design principles. I know that the idea that players can just read their stats and skills and get an idea of how good they are just by looking at the character and his posture, that was one of the design concepts Mike Hoge, the original Gothic inventor, was most passionate about. What are your thoughts on this?

117
00:11:06,190 --> 00:11:21,250
Javi: It's something super interesting and something we have all noticed when we were playing Gothic. It's especially something you notice in the hero himself. How he improves with the weapons and goes from barely knowing how to hold a sword to being a true master.

118
00:11:22,050 --> 00:11:28,280
Kai: Oh yes, barely knowing how to hold your sword... I remember that phase. [Yeah.] *laughing* Okay, go ahead.

119
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:35,030
Javi: It's something that we would like to keep and be able to give this feeling of power and progression.

120
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:46,240
Kai: Okay. Yeah, that sounds very good. And since you've mentioned progression: Another super important aspect, at least for me, is exactly that sense of progression. Progression of power, to be precise.

121
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:47,080
Javi: Yes.

122
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:51,270
Kai: Getting stronger and feeling the impact of that. [Yes.] How is that handled in the remake?

123
00:11:51,280 --> 00:12:13,070
Javi: The progression of power is something that is super important in the game. The character progression in the original Gothic was great. We want to keep the player progression as in the original, but we are refining how the player gets access to better weapons and items, especially in the midgame. It was very easy to break the economy and have the best equipment that money could buy.

124
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:20,190
Kai: Oh, yeah, that's true. Lovely. Thank you. Can I ask you TWO a few more questions that span across various topics?

125
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,200
Javi: [Okay.] Yes. Let's see if we can answer them.

126
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,230
Kai: I'm sure you can. Javi, where do you draw your inspiration from?

127
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:42,100
Javi: Inspiration can come from anywhere, not just another video games. Sometimes inspiration come from books, movies, series or even board games and roleplaying games. Often the best ideas come when you least expect them.

128
00:12:42,270 --> 00:12:49,160
Kai: Yes. And what are your favorite games? Are you planning to work some of what you liked about those games into the remake?

129
00:12:50,030 --> 00:13:12,030
Javi: I love action RPGs, but I play as many games as I can. When I play, I cannot stop being a designer and I am constantly analyzing the details and solutions that other devs have found. All these backlogs come to my mind when a new challenge appears in the development, and I think:""These games solved it in a very clever way. We could do something similar!""

130
00:13:12,090 --> 00:13:17,030
Kai: Cool. Yeah. Being open for that definitely helps. You don't always have to reinvent the wheel.

131
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:17,160
Javi: Yes.

132
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:22,290
Kai: The next couple of questions are community questions, which came up on the Discord server.

133
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,000
Javi: Oh, nice.

134
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:32,060
Reinhard: All your listeners out there are invited to join the Discord server as well. The invitation link is discord.gg/gothic.

135
00:13:32,210 --> 00:13:38,010
Kai: See you all there! So ... we've talked about forging. How about making arrows?

136
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:46,060
Javi: You will be able to make arrows on the workbenches if you have the materials. We want to incorporate crafting to make the materials you collect useful.

137
00:13:46,170 --> 00:13:58,280
Kai: Mm-hmm. Talking about making things useful: In the original game, there are barrels, including here in the old camp, that the player can climb into and hide. Is that going to be a useful mechanic in the remake?

138
00:13:59,150 --> 00:14:12,280
Javi: This mechanic is one of those we revise. In the original it didn't make much sense and it was too comical for the tone of the game. We want to develop stealth a little more, but I don't know if hiding in a barrel is the best way.

139
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:22,260
Kai: Ooooh *sighs*, okay. Now, we've been to the arena, so this fits quite nicely: A question that came up very often is:""Will there be helmets and shields?""

140
00:14:23,050 --> 00:14:33,270
Javi: No! We are sticking to the original and there won't be any. In the colony the combat is direct and visceral. We didn't like the defence system that will make it more static.

141
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:43,080
Kai: Yes, I agree. The next one is probably not so much a game design question, but it came up recently, so:""Will there be new quests?""

142
00:14:43,290 --> 00:14:56,030
Javi: Yes, there will be new quests. Our idea is to create quests to balance the parts of the game that feel more linear. As you know, from Chapter 3 onward the game offers no other quest than the main quest.

143
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:56,180
Kai: Oh yeah.

144
00:14:56,180 --> 00:15:06,290
Javi: And we would like to give more content to the player. On the other hand, some of the main quests will be slightly modified in order to close the plot holes that have been with us for 20 years.

145
00:15:07,090 --> 00:15:08,050
Kai: Very interesting.

146
00:15:08,210 --> 00:15:14,000
Reinhard: When we'll meet with someone from the story team in a future episode, we can dive more into these kind of questions.

147
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:25,250
Kai: Yeah, that'll be cool. Okay, next. I know this is a broad question, but I want to ask it as openly as possible. What can you tell us about the UI in the remake, and specifically the inventory?

148
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:47,040
Javi: The UI will look more like the original Gothic than the Playable Teaser. [Yes!] We are doing something minimal to enhance the player immersion. The inventory follows the rules of the original Gothic. The game doesn't pause and allows you to watch as you manage it. It's a screen with a lot of information, so it's a challenge to show everything at once.

149
00:15:47,290 --> 00:16:00,240
Kai: M-hm, it is! Okay, but now for something completely different. We've heard a few characters speaking in this episode, and those were all audio files from the original game. But, Reinhard, we won't use those in the remake, right?

150
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:07,240
Reinhard: No! We thought initially that's the best way to approach it, but we realized that this wouldn't make any changes or additions possible.

151
00:16:08,110 --> 00:16:14,030
Kai: Which means that we will mostly do rerecordings with the original actors - where it's possible -, right?

152
00:16:14,190 --> 00:16:15,050
Reinhard: Yep.

153
00:16:15,270 --> 00:16:22,200
Kai: Alright. That's good news to me! And which gameplay features and mechanics are we adding that we weren't in the original game?

154
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:37,060
Javi: We are working on several new features. As a preview, you will now be able to climb some walls in the game. This allows us to reward the more exploratory players and also to develop more vertical levels.

155
00:16:37,170 --> 00:16:39,180
Kai: Uuuh... climbing walls. Nice!

156
00:16:40,150 --> 00:16:51,080
Javi: We have also redesigned pickpocketing, lockpicking, some crafting systems... We have more surprises, but we don't want to reveal them all at once.

157
00:16:51,230 --> 00:16:55,000
Kai: Yeah, that makes sense. We have to keep some for the next episodes.

158
00:16:55,120 --> 00:17:05,080
Reinhard: It's starting to get dark. We've been chatting for quite a while. [Oh, yes.] Kai, how about we end this episode with some music? Night in the old camp, maybe?

159
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:10,020
Kai: I was hoping for you to ask that. Yeah, I'd love to share some of that.

160
00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:14,000
Reinhard: Okay, then. Do you have any other questions before we wrap this up?

161
00:17:14,010 --> 00:17:18,220
Kai: Yes. About that letter... who is it for? You're making such a big secret out of it.

162
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:24,240
Reinhard: Oh, yeah, I completely forgot about that. [Sure.] Guess we'll leave that for the next episode, then.

163
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:30,160
Kai: That's a pretty decent cliffhanger. Anyways, Javi, thank you so much for joining us.

164
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:36,080
Javi: Thanks for inviting me. I'm looking forward to coming back and talking more about the Gothic remake.

165
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:43,100
Kai: Yes, that will be great. So, here's a bit of night music from the old camp. See you all in the next episode.

166
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:44,160
Javi: Bye bye, everybody.

167
00:17:44,190 --> 00:17:46,150
Reinhard: Take care. Bye Bye.

168
00:20:16,010 --> 00:20:22,000
Kai: Thank you for listening. That was... Chapter 2.
