00:00:25,210 --> 00:00:30,270
Ксардас: Розділ перший

2
00:00:30,270 --> 00:00:38,000
Кай: Де він? Я впевнений, що ми домовилися про плац обміну, але його тут немає.

3
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,070
Кай: Райнхард? РАЙНХАРДЕ?

4
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:49,000
Кай: Ну добре. Вітаю всіх і ласкаво прошу на...

5
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,180
Кай: Якого біса?!

6
00:00:52,090 --> 00:00:58,090
Райнхард: Я вже тут.

7
00:00:58,090 --> 00:01:02,170
Кай: Нащо, на ім'я Хорініса, ти стрибнув у воду? Ти міг просто зайти через вхід для працівників.

8
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:05,230
Райнхард: Я знаю, але я люблю цей стрибок.

9
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:10,100
Кай: І що тепер? Скажеш, що маєш листа для магів вогню?

10
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:14,260
Рейнхард: Майже. У мене є лист, але він для когось іншого.

11
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:19,280
Kai: Mmh, fine. So now that you're here, let's start over.

12
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:21,130
Reinhard: Ready when you are.

13
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:26,130
Kai: Hi, everyone. And welcome to the""Gothic Remake Behind the Scenes Podcast"".

14
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:29,010
Reinhard: That's a mouthful. We need a shorter name.

15
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:34,060
Kai: ""Behind the Gothic Remake Podcast ... thingy"".

16
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:35,100
Reinhard: That's shorter.

17
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:41,130
Kai: Oh, look, there's Diego. I was so looking forward to meeting him. Hey, Diego. I'm...

18
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:50,230
Diego: I'm not interested in who you are. [Well, I...] You've just arrived. I look after the new arrivals. That's all for now.

19
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:55,000
Reinhard: Thanks, Diego. I'll take care of him. This is Kai Rosenkranz, our composer.

20
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:03,010
Reinhard: He wrote the soundtrack to the original game more than 20 years ago. Now he's back to do it again for the Gothic 1 remake.

21
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:04,260
Diego: That's very good for you.

22
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:08,170
Reinhard: Yeah, He has a crew access pass. I'll show him around.

23
00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:11,150
Kai: Yes, It was about time I get to see the new sets.

24
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:15,020
Diego: Well then ... you really seem to be an alright guy.

25
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:18,160
Kai: Thank you. I think I'm... (interrupted)

26
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:20,100
Diego: Go now! We'll meet in the old camp.

27
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:21,280
Kai: Yes. Okay.

28
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:30,070
Kai: Aww, he's such a great guy. And thanks for the introduction, Reinhard. Now, tell everyone who you are.

29
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:38,120
Reinhard: I am Reinhard Pollice, studio manager and game director at Alkimia Interactive, the studio behind the Gothic 1 remake.

30
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:43,190
Kai: And you're a diehard Gothic fan and involved in the series for a very long time.

31
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,230
Reinhard: Yes, that's true.

32
00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:53,160
Kai: We'll get back to that. But first, about that shorter name for this podcast. Why don't we just call it the""Gothic Remake Podcast""?

33
00:02:53,260 --> 00:03:01,000
Reinhard: GRP. Sounds good. So welcome to the first episode of the""Gothic Remake Podcast"".

34
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,230
Kai: Yay! Exciting times. We've known each other for what, 15 years now?

35
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:20,170
Reinhard: Even longer. We first worked together around the launch of Gothic 3 in 2006. Or even earlier than that?

36
00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:23,010
Kai: You worked for JoWooD at that time, right?

37
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:26,130
Reinhard: Yes!  [ That's... ] I know!

38
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:40,160
Kai: If I remember correctly, it was you who made this fantastic fan camping during the Games Convention possible. I used to go camping with Gothic fans every year and you helped turning it into a community camping right next to the actually convention center?

39
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:48,110
Reinhard: Kind of true. But in the end, JoWooD and especially a guy named Ivan Ertlov made it possible. Special shout out to him here.

40
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:53,010
Kai: Ivan! Yo, my man. What was your job exactly around that time?

41
00:03:53,130 --> 00:04:01,000
Reinhard: It wasn't actually a real job because I was still going to school, but I helped JoWooD with communities, beta tests and supporting games.

42
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:06,270
Reinhard: Gothic had a sizable and active community team already, so I was mostly working on Spellforce at that time.

43
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:13,040
Kai: Cool. So now, more than two decades after the release of Gothic 1, we're making a podcast together.

44
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:15,210
Reinhard: Hold on. (squishy sound)

45
00:04:18,110 --> 00:04:20,000
Kai: Did you just smash a meatbug?

46
00:04:20,110 --> 00:04:21,100
Reinhard: I guess I did.

47
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:25,180
Kai: Classic. But why are we doing a podcast?

48
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:40,000
Reinhard: I guess because it makes us two independent. We can just walk around in this beautiful world as it's being built and talk about any aspect of the development process of the game without having to worry about visuals - since this is audio only.

49
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:46,120
Reinhard: No visual assets need to be finished. Parts of the world can still be under construction. It just doesn't matter.

50
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:50,090
Kai: Maybe our audience would love to see some work in progress assets.

51
00:04:50,090 --> 00:05:00,150
Reinhard: Oh yeah, absolutely. We'll have those as well: on YouTube, our Discord channel, the Steam page... But for now, this gives us a bit more freedom.

52
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:07,020
Kai: I love it. We can just walk around, talk, meet people ... [squishy sound] ... crush meatbugs...

53
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:17,120
Reinhard: Exactly. This episode is about what we think is a good remake. Which aspects we are recreating accurately and where we are adding new content.

54
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:19,260
Kai: So there will be new content?

55
00:05:20,030 --> 00:05:24,190
Reinhard: Yes. I'm pretty sure you know that since you've already written some new music.

56
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:28,150
Kai: Oh, yeah. I'm just pointing out that now you officially confirmed it.

57
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:39,000
Reinhard: It's going to be a very faithful recreation of the original game. The same world, the same beloved characters, the same story, pretty much the same everything.

58
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,210
Reinhard: But we are adding a few things here and there where it just makes sense.

59
00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:44,040
Kai: Like what?

60
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Reinhard: Just wait and see. But I'll give you some good examples.

61
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:58,170
Reinhard: For example, the original Gothic had some plot holes, open ends, unexplained backgrounds, or even some bigger logic flaws, and we are using those to tie in a few new ideas.

62
00:05:58,230 --> 00:06:01,170
Kai: Whoa, whoa, whoa. What do you mean by""logic flaws""?

63
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:06,140
Reinhard: Wait, have you been involved in writing of the original story?

64
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,020
Kai: No. No. Only music, sound effects and visual effects. No worries. Go ahead.

65
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:20,090
Reinhard: Okay. Anyways, there's room for new ideas without changing the original. Just wait and see. [And hear!] Right.

66
00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:26,200
Kai: What's your personal relationship with Gothic? Or in other words, how much of a fan are you?

67
00:06:27,030 --> 00:06:36,270
Reinhard: I played a ton of the original games and I got hooked because of the rough tone. Later, I spent a lot of my time working on mods and learning game development. This way.

68
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:37,240
Kai: Nice.

69
00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:39,180
Reinhard: And what about you?

70
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:45,300
Kai: I joined Piranha Bytes when I was 18 in 1998, and I was still at school at that time.

71
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:55,000
Kai: I had made the decision to try to become a game developer and I was looking for some studios in my area that I could visit and just get an idea of what it's like to be a game developer.

72
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Kai: And then I realized that Piranha Bytes was actually located in my hometown. So I went there and paid them a visit.

73
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:03,040
Reinhard: The right place at the right time.

74
00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:12,000
Kai: Oh, absolutely. I was so lucky. I visited them at the time when they were still just a handful of people in a tiny office room and some external programmers.

75
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:19,080
Kai: A few weeks later, I started working on the music for the game and I stayed with Piranha Bytes for 12 years as a composer and sound designer.

76
00:07:20,130 --> 00:07:23,030
Reinhard: Which was the last Piranha Bytes game that you've worked on?

77
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,040
Kai: Risen 1.

78
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:28,060
Reinhard: And when was the last time you've played actually Gothic one?

79
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:37,200
Kai: I played it live on Twitch 3 or 4 years ago. But to be honest, I had to rediscover most of the game. There was so much I had forgotten over those past two decades.

80
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:49,090
Reinhard: Understandably. And if you had to name the most important aspects of Gothic, the defining qualities. Which would you pick? What is the soul, the spirit - whatever you want to call it - of Gothic?

81
00:07:49,150 --> 00:08:04,150
Kai: Wow, that's a big question. Number one, the setting and tone. It's stark, It's gritty, it's violent, it's relentless. And the way it presents a male kind of testosterone filled prison colony really fits for me.

82
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:12,000
Kai: The tone is harsh and it has a very distinctive flair that is really super important for me. We have to nail this part.

83
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,090
Reinhard: Oh, yeah.

84
00:08:13,090 --> 00:08:15,070
Kai: Voiceovers play a huge role, too.

85
00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:16,040
Reinhard: Definitely.

86
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:26,200
Kai: Number #2: The living world. The world isn't just a stage for the player. All the creatures and all the NPCs, they just have to behave believably.

87
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:38,060
Kai: They have to react accordingly to what the player does. And also to what's happening around them. So this whole living, breathing organism of a world, this has to be presented in a in a super believable way.

88
00:08:38,210 --> 00:08:43,280
Kai: And the original Gothic already had that. So we have to try to push it even further.

89
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:44,230
Reinhard: Yes.

90
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:53,200
Kai: And the third aspect would be the sense of progression and how it is presented. You start as a nobody, but that doesn't mean that you're a weak character.

91
00:08:53,200 --> 00:09:05,000
Kai: Right from the beginning, the nameless hero is the kind of guy to deal out some soundbites and punches, but still there is this very rewarding sense of progression and the sense of achievement when you get stronger.

92
00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:12,070
Kai: You can even see it in the way you hold your sword and the way you fight. The sense of achievement really matters a lot to me.

93
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:15,130
Reinhard: Interesting.

94
00:09:15,170 --> 00:09:19,040
Kai: Now your turn. Which aspect would you think are the most important?

95
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:29,000
Reinhard: I mostly like the living world with its daily routines that not only NPCs have, but also creatures, it really feels alive and reacting.

96
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:45,110
Reinhard: I also like a lot the ungated experience. The whole world is literally open to you if you have the skill to beat some tough monsters. And of course, I also like the rough tone, the dialogs, the reactions of the nameless hero and the NPCs... It's all well thought out!

97
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:46,240
Kai: Yeah, I agree.

98
00:09:48,090 --> 00:09:51,240
Reinhard: And now here we are back in this world, walking to the old camp.

99
00:09:52,220 --> 00:10:01,060
Kai: And I got to say, it looks phenomenal. So familiar and so true to the original, but so good! The visual quality is amazing.

100
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:03,210
Reinhard: It's a podcast, Kai. Audio only!

101
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:09,070
Kai: I know, but still, if only you all could see this. Look, there's the gate with Orry.

102
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:12,080
Reinhard: Yes. This part of the world is pretty much complete.

103
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:18,250
Kai: I love it. What would you say, what percentage of the world is already finished or almost finished?

104
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:28,200
Reinhard: That's hard to say. There's like a first iteration of everything, except maybe some minor locations. But at this level of detail, I'd say around 50%.

105
00:10:29,130 --> 00:10:30,270
Kai: So still a long way to go.

106
00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:36,180
Reinhard: Yes, but once the workflows and technical aspects are established, it gets a lot faster.

107
00:10:36,270 --> 00:10:39,140
Kai: Did you keep anything from the playable teaser version?

108
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:46,060
Reinhard: Nothing, except a few raw art assets. We even completely started from a blank Unreal project.

109
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:54,250
Kai: Okay, before we talk about that, let's go back to the very beginning of the Gothic remake project. It was you who pushed it internally at THQ Nordic, right?

110
00:10:55,050 --> 00:10:56,130
Reinhard: Yes, I was part of this.

111
00:10:57,020 --> 00:11:02,020
Kai: So it is fair to say that we owe this to you, right? Without you, this project wouldn't exist.

112
00:11:02,070 --> 00:11:03,110
Reinhard: No, no, no. I was just...

113
00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:10,260
Kai: Yes, yes, yes. I know this was your passion project, and you were planning to do it for a very long time, waiting for the right opportunity.

114
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:16,140
Kai: And I just want to say thank you for making this possible. [Reinhard grumbles.] You don't have to respond. That's okay.

115
00:11:17,030 --> 00:11:24,090
Reinhard: There was a few people involved in that process. In the end, a remake felt like a natural step with a series that was dormant for more than ten years.

116
00:11:24,270 --> 00:11:28,060
Kai: How did it all start? Who did you have to convince and how?

117
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:37,200
Reinhard: Well, we obviously have a process of THQ Nordic about new project, but since we distributed the old Gothic games, we knew very well the potential of those games.

118
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:45,230
Reinhard: And then one thing led to the other, and we needed a proof of concept for the team making such a production. And so we did the playable teaser.

119
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:53,180
Kai: Was it your plan from the very beginning to involve the community in the, let's say, design and feedback process?

120
00:11:54,150 --> 00:12:02,150
Reinhard: Not for the playable teaser, but we knew Gothic always had a very strong and opinionated community, and we wanted to make sure they feel part of it.

121
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:11,230
Kai: Nice. In your opinion, what is a remake in comparison to a remaster or reboot, and what do you think makes a good remake?

122
00:12:12,130 --> 00:12:28,050
Reinhard: That's easily explained. A remake is a full recreation of something existing without deviating too much from the original. A remaster is literally taking the old piece of code and just getting it running on modern systems and doing selective changes.

123
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:30,090
Kai: And sometimes visual updates. Right?

124
00:12:30,190 --> 00:12:40,200
Reinhard: Exactly. And a reboot is essentially what we did with the playable teaser. So taking the original ideas and just running with it in different directions.

125
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:48,250
Reinhard: The remake is really a chance to do everything in a modern and future proof way and also extend it where it will provide a lot of value to the game.

126
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:52,020
Kai: So just to be clear, we're making a remake, right?

127
00:12:52,030 --> 00:12:53,290
Reinhard: Yes, we're making a remake now.

128
00:12:54,290 --> 00:13:04,190
Kai: Oh, hold on. There's that blocked mining tunnel from the original game. And here's... [pickup sound] Tadaa! Our first weapon, A pickaxe.

129
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,180
Reinhard: Right where it used to be.

130
00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:13,230
Kai: Very cool. The tunnel entrance is still blocked. Are you planning to put anything in there or will it stay blocked?

131
00:13:14,050 --> 00:13:15,100
Reinhard: We will all see.

132
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:23,000
Kai: Ehm, you've mentioned the playable teaser. Can you explain which thoughts went into it and why it turned out the way it did?

133
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Reinhard: The original plan was never to release it. Initially, we wanted to create a proof of concept that this team can work on such a big project.

134
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Reinhard: But then, so much of our own thoughts went into it and it was more a reboot, and we felt the need to either sanity-check it or - like - go back to a safe ground.

135
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,300
Reinhard: In the end, THQ Nordic suggested to release the playable teaser and ask for feedback.

136
00:13:47,270 --> 00:13:49,180
Kai: And then the fan feedback came in.

137
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:50,200
Reinhard: Yes.

138
00:13:50,210 --> 00:13:54,070
Kai: What was your process of evaluating it and what did you learn from it?

139
00:13:54,260 --> 00:14:06,200
Reinhard: Well, all the feedback came in in a gigantic spreadsheet and we went through all of it. And the most interesting thing was really to see how much different opinions were there about certain details.

140
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:11,130
Reinhard: But in the end, the good thing was that there was a lot of common ground among the Gothic community.

141
00:14:13,010 --> 00:14:14,240
Kai: So you decided to start from scratch?

142
00:14:15,070 --> 00:14:24,080
Reinhard: Yes, exactly. In the process of making the playable teaser shippable, we took a lot of shortcuts and it just wasn't architected from the start to live on.

143
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:36,080
Reinhard: We as a team, we never used Unreal before. So we also made some mistakes on how we set up certain things and we just wanted to have a clean slate for the full production and not live with actually a lot of tech depth.

144
00:14:37,130 --> 00:14:42,180
Kai: That's crazy. And just to be clear, when you say Unreal, you mean the Unreal Engine, right?

145
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:45,040
Reinhard: Yes. We're using the Unreal Engine.

146
00:14:45,290 --> 00:14:52,020
Kai: So how would you answer the following question?""Why should we trust the team that did the playable teaser?""

147
00:14:53,040 --> 00:15:01,290
Reinhard: Because we went through all the feedback and created good action items based on that. We created a vision that is very much in line with what the community wants.

148
00:15:02,290 --> 00:15:03,220
Kai: M-hm.

149
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:06,070
Reinhard: One second! See that molerat over there?

150
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:08,000
Kai: Right where it used to be.

151
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:22,220
Reinhard: Watch. [fighting and squeaking sounds]

152
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:28,170
Kai: Nice! That looked extremely smooth. Very cool. Is that the new combat system?

153
00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:39,100
Reinhard: Yes. It's based on the Gothic 1 system and it has the same feel to it with instant reactions, different attacks, combos, and kind of the same rhythm.

154
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:46,120
Reinhard: We've modernized the controls and gameplay to a certain degree, but decided to go a completely different route than in the playable teaser.

155
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:48,040
Kai: That's very good.

156
00:15:49,010 --> 00:15:55,010
Reinhard: Modernizing the gameplay is the trickiest part, but I think we've got good solutions for all gameplay aspects now.

157
00:15:55,140 --> 00:16:03,020
Kai: Yeah, I'm very curious about this one and also a little worried. But I got to say, everything that I saw so far looks very, very good.

158
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:13,060
Reinhard: Now we have to leave this part of the podcast to the listeners imagination. But let's talk about an aspect that lends itself perfectly to a podcast.

159
00:16:13,170 --> 00:16:14,200
Kai: Read some source code?

160
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:18,050
Reinhard: Oh, yeah. No, I mean your music!

161
00:16:18,130 --> 00:16:24,000
Kai: Oh, yeah. As of now, I've already written more than one hour of new music for the Gothic Remake.

162
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:25,230
Reinhard: Shall we listen to some of it?

163
00:16:26,050 --> 00:16:34,000
Kai: Sure. We're in the middle of nowhere on the path that leads down to the old camp. Let me play some snippets of the music that plays here.

164
00:16:34,000 --> 00:17:23,160
Music: [Music for the path from exchange zone to old camp]

165
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:28,080
Reinhard: Sweet. So this is definitely based on the original soundtrack.

166
00:17:28,150 --> 00:17:31,080
Kai: Yes. My plan is to follow a""three thirds rule"".

167
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:33,010
Reinhard: What's that?

168
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:41,200
Kai: There wasn't a lot of music in Gothic one, and it was repeating and looping a lot. So I am considering this original soundtrack the first of three thirds.

169
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:51,020
Kai: So the first third is all the original melodies, all the original themes that were in the original game but remastered and modernized so that they sound good in a modern game.

170
00:17:51,180 --> 00:18:02,250
Kai: Then the second set would be variations on these themes. You recognize the material, but there are slight modifications. There are rearrangements and maybe extensions to the original material.

171
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:12,040
Kai: And then the third third would be completely new music. So there will be tracks for places in the world that didn't have their own music in the original game, and some other things.

172
00:18:12,210 --> 00:18:16,100
Reinhard: That make sense. Can you play a piece to demonstrate that?

173
00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:21,300
Kai: Absolutely. Here's the night version for the music for this area.

174
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Kai: [Night music plays]

175
00:18:31,070 --> 00:18:35,300
Kai: It's the remastered version of the original theme. So the first third.

176
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Kai: And this part is completely new.

177
00:19:35,230 --> 00:19:40,000
Kai: Now, this is the second third based on the same motif.

178
00:20:03,050 --> 00:20:05,270
Reinhard: Oh, wow. Thank you, Kai. That's very interesting.

179
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:17,080
Kai: Thank you. Is there a similar guideline for the entire game? I mean, do you have a plan as to how much you want to keep 100% accurate and how much you want to add or modify?

180
00:20:17,230 --> 00:20:27,260
Reinhard: I can't come up with a percentage, but the plan is to stay very close where the original shined. So, like the world design, the general mechanics and also the story.

181
00:20:28,130 --> 00:20:36,190
Kai: Very cool. Can we talk a little bit about yourself? [Okay.] Like, what exactly is your role in the Remake's development?

182
00:20:37,050 --> 00:20:40,130
Reinhard: I am the game director and managing director for Alkimia.

183
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:43,140
Kai: So how much creative influence do you have?

184
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:56,090
Reinhard: I created the vision for the Gothic remake and all its important features. Now that we are focusing on the implementation details, I make sure to supervise important features and workflows, like, for example, the daily routines.

185
00:20:57,010 --> 00:21:00,090
Kai: What would you say has been your biggest personal influence on the remake?

186
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:03,060
Reinhard: It's hard to name a few. There's just so many.

187
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:06,240
Kai: You are originally from Austria, right?

188
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:12,050
Reinhard: Yes, that's right. So I also speak the original language Gothic was created in.

189
00:21:12,150 --> 00:21:17,160
Kai: And now you're heading a studio in Barcelona. How did you get there? Why Barcelona?

190
00:21:17,230 --> 00:21:28,170
Reinhard: I lived here for a few years and never really had the plan to run a studio here. But then I discovered that there are so many talented game developers here and mostly were just stuck with mobile game studios.

191
00:21:29,150 --> 00:21:32,180
Kai: How did you go about founding a new studio and a new city?

192
00:21:32,230 --> 00:21:42,200
Reinhard: It was an extra challenge because of the pandemic. We started Alkimia in March 2020. I got to know that there are a lot of talented game developers in the city.

193
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:55,240
Reinhard: So I got to know a core team of five people who I thought were really talented and they were - like - already working together in the past. And so we - just like - throw around ideas what we could work on together.

194
00:21:55,280 --> 00:22:07,060
Reinhard: And so we settled on""let's just start to work on the medieval RPG"", which later became Gothic, and then actually founding the studio was an extra challenge because of the pandemic.

195
00:22:07,230 --> 00:22:13,240
Kai: At that time it was THQ Nordic Barcelona Studio, which then later became Alkimia Interactive, right?

196
00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:25,060
Reinhard: Yes. The plan was never really to stay THQ Nordic Barcelona. It was just our team's name when we needed a team's name for the release of the playable teaser.

197
00:22:23,150 --> 00:22:27,190
Kai: Alkimia Interactive: That's Spanish for alchemy, I guess, right?

198
00:22:27,270 --> 00:22:37,200
Reinhard: Sí señor. But it's actually even cooler. Alkimia is a Basque word, which is a language spoken in the Basque country, which is situated in the north of Spain.

199
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:41,110
Kai: Aha! How many people are working at Alkimia right now?

200
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:43,130
Reinhard: We are around 40 people now.

201
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,130
Kai: And how did you come up with that name?

202
00:22:45,200 --> 00:23:03,180
Reinhard: We released the playable teaser as THQ Nordic Barcelona, but after this there was a need to create a unique name - an own identity. So we started to gather names among the team, and in the end it was between two names. And so we chose Alkimia Interactive. And the short form is A.I.

203
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:07,280
Kai: Uhh, fancy. Is the team going to grow even more?

204
00:23:08,110 --> 00:23:10,240
Reinhard: Yes, we are always looking for talented people.

205
00:23:12,010 --> 00:23:14,260
Kai: And is it easy to get new staff in Barcelona?

206
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:29,060
Reinhard: Barcelona and Spain, fortunately, has a lot of passionate and talented video game developers. And even better, a lot of them are waiting to work on such a big project for a long time. Here we are, the old camp.

207
00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:31,040
Kai: Wow. Just wow.

208
00:23:31,090 --> 00:23:32,130
Reinhard: Pretty cool, huh?

209
00:23:32,250 --> 00:23:35,070
Kai: Yes. I ... I can't wait to explore it.

210
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:38,260
Gate Guard: Where do you think you're going? You ain't come to make trouble, have ya?

211
00:23:39,090 --> 00:23:44,240
Kai: No, no, no. I'm a music guy, and I'm going to help build the stage for the concert. I heard you'll be yodeling?

212
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:50,180
Gate Guard: Hey, this guy's funny. I don't like funny guys. [draws sword]

213
00:23:51,010 --> 00:23:57,100
Reinhard: Wait. Actually, here's our access pass. Also, I have this letter that I have to bring to ... someone!

214
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:59,110
Gate Guard: Okay. In you go, then.

215
00:23:59,190 --> 00:24:00,170
Kai: And what about me?

216
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:04,250
Gate Guard: I'll make an exception just this once, 'cause you're new here.

217
00:24:05,090 --> 00:24:10,120
Kai: Thanks, I guess. Oh, Reinhard, you you mentioned a letter. Who is it for?

218
00:24:10,270 --> 00:24:28,190
Reinhard: You will see! ... In another episode of the""GRP"".
